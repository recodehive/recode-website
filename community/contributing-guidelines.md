## Local Setup Guide

### How to set up recode hive:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recodehive-website.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd recodehive-website
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Running the Application:**

   Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the application locally using:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start a development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Environment Setup (for GitHub API access)

Some parts of the dashboard — such as the Leaderboard — require access to the GitHub API.
To avoid rate-limit issues, you’ll need to set up a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) locally.

1. **Copy the example environment file**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   This creates your local `.env` configuration file.

2. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token**
   1. Go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   2. Click **“Generate new token (classic)”**
   3. Give it a name (e.g. `recode hive`)
   4. Select **no special permissions** (the default is fine for public data)
   5. Copy the generated token

3. **Add your token to `.env`**

   Open `.env` and update this line:

   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_generated_token_here
   ```

## Contributing to recode hive

We welcome contributions! Follow these steps to get started.

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Go to the [recode hive repository](https://github.com/recodehive/recode-website) and click **Fork**.

2. **Clone Your Fork Locally**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recodehive-website.git
   cd recodehive-website
   ```

3. **Add the Original Repository as Upstream**

   This allows you to fetch changes from the main repository to keep your fork up to date.

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream <repo-url>
   ```

   Verify the remotes:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   You should see both origin (your fork) and upstream (main repository).

4. **Keep Your Fork Updated**

   Before starting a new feature or bug fix, update your local main branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

   This ensures your branch starts from the latest version of the main repository.

5. **Create a New Branch**

   Create a branch for your feature or bug fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

   ## Branch Validation

   To ensure that branch names follow our naming conventions, use the following guidelines. The branch name should match the required pattern, and feedback will be provided if it does not.

   ### Valid Branch Name Pattern

   Branch names should follow this regex pattern:

   ```
   ^((fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore|perf|task|shared)\/-[0-9A-Za-z-]+|misc-[0-9A-Za-z-]+)$
   ```

   ### Example Branch Names

   - `fix/1234-fix-bug`
   - `misc-1234-description`

   ### Valid Types

   - **fix:** A bug fix
   - **docs:** Documentation only changes
   - **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
   - **refactor:** A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
   - **test:** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   - **chore:** Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
   - **perf:** A code change that improves performance
   - **task:** A task that needs to be done
   - **shared:** Shared code or resources
   - **misc:** Miscellaneous changes

6. **Commit Your Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
   ```
   #### Commit Message Format

   We use [Commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) with the [git-cz](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-cz) adapter to ensure consistent commit messages that follow a standard changelog style. This helps in generating changelogs and maintaining a clear project history.

   Commit messages should follow this pattern:

   ```
   <type>: [#<GIT-ISSUE>] <subject>
   ```
   - **type**: The type of change that you're committing. It should be one of the following:
     - **feat**: A new feature
     - **fix**: A bug fix
     - **docs**: Documentation only changes
     - **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
     - **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
     - **perf**: A code change that improves performance
     - **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
     - **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
     - **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

   - **GIT-ISSUE**: The Git issue ID associated with the change.
   - **subject**: A brief description of the change.

   ### Example Commit Messages:

   - `feat: [#1] Add user login functionality`
   - `fix: [#24] Resolve navbar alignment issue`
   - `chore: [#101] Update dependencies to latest versions`

   ### Using Commitizen with Husky

   We have configured [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) to automatically run Commitizen when you commit changes. This is done using the `prepare-commit-msg` hook. Simply use the `git commit` command, and Commitizen will guide you through the commit message creation process.


7. **Push Your Branch to Your Fork**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

8. **Open a Pull Request**
   1. Go to your fork on GitHub.

   2. Click Compare & pull request for your branch.

   3. Fill out the PR template with a clear description of your changes.

   4. Submit the PR.

   > Tip: If your branch falls behind main, you can fetch and merge updates from upstream again before pushing.

## Formatting

To ensure consistent code style and catch errors before committing, please follow these steps:

2. **Automatically fix linting issues where possible**:

   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   ```

3. **Format code according to project conventions**:

   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

4. **Build the project to verify everything compiles correctly**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   It’s recommended to run these commands before committing to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Branding & Naming Conventions

- Use **`recode hive`** in lowercase for all mentions of the project name.
- Update any headers, titles, or utility constants accordingly.

### Exceptions to Lowercase Branding

While we use lowercase **`recode hive`** throughout the project for consistency, there are some places where the exact repository name with capitalization must be used:

- Repository-specific badges (e.g., [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks))
- GitHub repository URLs in tools or badges
- Any external services that require exact repo names

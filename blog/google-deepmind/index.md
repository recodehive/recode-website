## 🌍 Why DeepMind Matters

DeepMind's AI achievements aren't just about games. Its implications are massive:

- 🔋 **Energy Efficiency:**
  DeepMind helped Google **reduce its data center cooling bills by 40%** by optimizing energy efficiency.

- 👁️ **Healthcare Applications:**
  In partnership with the **UK's National Health Service**, DeepMind Health utilizes AI to spot critical eye conditions. The goal is to eventually use algorithms to personalize healthcare treatments, determining what works best for patients based on their clinical history.

- 🗣️ **Speech Recognition:**
  Projects like **WaveNet** have created more natural-sounding human speech for tools like Google Assistant.

## 🧠 How DeepMind AI Works

Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on predefined rules, DeepMind uses **deep learning** and **reinforcement learning**.

DeepMind is a subsidiary of Google that focuses on artificial intelligence. More specifically, it uses a field of AI called machine learning, which includes approaches like deep neural networks and reinforcement learning to make predictions. This relies on massive datasets, allowing the AI to learn and improve on its own.

- **Self-play Learning:**
  AlphaGo combined a **Monte-Carlo tree search with deep neural networks**. These networks were first trained on human expert games and then refined through reinforcement learning from millions of games of self-play.

- **Real-World Tasks:**
  Beyond games, deep learning models trained on millions of data points are used for complex tasks like image and speech recognition.

## 🧾 The DeepMind Origin Story

Many earlier AI programs, like IBM’s Deep Blue which defeated Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, used explicit, rule-based systems that relied on programmers to write the code. However, machine learning enables computers to teach themselves and establish their own rules through which they make predictions.

![Google DeepMind Logo and AI concepts](/img/blogs/02-deepmind.png)

- Founded in 2010 by **Demis Hassabis**, **Shane Legg**, and **Mustafa Suleyman**.
- Backed by prominent investors like **Jaan Tallinn** (co-founder of Skype).
- In 2014, Google acquired the London-based AI company. According to The Information, the acquisition price was over **$500 million**.
- Grew from a small startup to a global AI powerhouse under Google's leadership.

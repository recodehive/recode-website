In the fast-evolving world of software development, AI-powered tools are changing the game. GitHub is at the forefront with its latest innovation: the **GitHub Copilot Coding Agent**. More than just an in-editor assistant, this powerful new agent works asynchronously to handle entire engineering tasks on its own. Let's dive into what it is, how it works, and how you can leverage it to automate your workflow.
### üöÄ **What Is GitHub Coding Agent**  
The GitHub Copilot Coding Agent is an asynchronous software engineering agent that:

- ‚úÖTakes GitHub Issues as input.
- ‚úÖWrites code, runs tests, and creates pull requests‚Äîjust like a teammate.
- ‚úÖWorks inside GitHub Actions, unlike the real-time agent mode in your IDE (e.g., VS Code).

### üîß How It Works

**1. Write & Assign an Issue to Copilot**  
When creating an issue for the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent, clarity and structure are key to getting the best results. Here‚Äôs how to craft an effective issue that sets Copilot up for success:

- **Provide Clear Context:**  
    Begin by describing the problem or feature request in detail. Explain *why* the change is needed, referencing any relevant background, user stories, or business goals. If the issue relates to a bug, include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and any error messages or screenshots.

- **Define Expected Outcomes:**  
    Clearly state what a successful resolution looks like. For features, you can add the image of expected output or drawings etc. 

- **Include Technical Details:**  
    Add any technical constraints, dependencies, or architectural considerations. Link to relevant code, documentation, or previous issues/PRs. If there are specific files, functions, or APIs involved, mention them explicitly.

- **Use Templates and Repo Instructions:**  
    Leverage your repository‚Äôs issue templates to maintain consistency. Follow any contribution guidelines or coding standards documented in the repo. This ensures Copilot‚Äôs work aligns with your team‚Äôs practices.

- **Assign the Issue to Copilot:**  
    Just like you would with a human teammate, assign the issue to Copilot. This triggers the agent workflow and signals that the issue is ready for automated handling.

### **Example Issue Template:**

```markdown
Summary
Briefly describe the task or bug.

Context
Explain why this change is needed. Link to related issues or documentation.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] List specific outcomes or deliverables
- [ ] Include test coverage or documentation updates if needed

Technical Notes
Mention files, functions, or dependencies involved.

Additional Info
Add screenshots, logs, or references as needed.
```

By following these steps, you ensure Copilot has all the information it needs to deliver high-quality, context-aware code changes‚Äîmaking your workflow smoother and more efficient.


### üåü What Happens Next?

Once you assign the issue to GitHub Copilot, the agent will analyze the requirements and begin working asynchronously. It may take a short while for Copilot to generate the code, run tests, and open a new pull request (PR) with the proposed changes.

You can expect:

- A new PR created automatically by Copilot, referencing the original issue.  
    [An example Pull Request created by GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/recodehive/recode-website/pull/141)
- Automated test results and code suggestions included in the PR.
- Clear traceability between your issue and the resulting code changes.

Stay engaged by reviewing the PR, providing feedback, or merging it when ready. This workflow helps you leverage automation while maintaining control over your codebase.

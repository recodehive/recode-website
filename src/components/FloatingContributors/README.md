# FloatingContributors Component

The `FloatingContributors` component is a dynamic React component that displays live GitHub activity and a list of contributors for the `recodehive/recode-website` repository. It fetches data from GitHub APIs, processes it, and renders it in an interactive and animated UI.

---

## Features

### 1. **Live GitHub Activity**
- Displays recent events such as pushes, pull requests, comments, and more.
- Cycles through activities every 4 seconds.

### 2. **Contributors Grid**
- Shows the top contributors with their avatars, GitHub profiles, and contribution counts.
- Displays tooltips with additional contributor details.

### 3. **Animations**
- Smooth animations for floating effects, hover interactions, and transitions using `framer-motion`.

### 4. **Fallback Mechanism**
- Uses hardcoded fallback data when GitHub API calls fail.

### 5. **Caching**
- Caches API responses in `localStorage` for 2 minutes to reduce API calls.

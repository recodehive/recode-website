# Tuples in Python

A **Tuple** is an immutable, ordered collection of elements.  
Unlike lists, **tuples cannot be changed after creation**, which makes them useful for storing fixed collections of data.


## Creating a Tuple

Tuples are created using parentheses `()` or simply commas:

```python
# Empty Tuple
empty_tuple = ()

# Tuple with multiple items
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# Tuple without parentheses (comma-separated)
numbers = 1, 2, 3

# Single-element Tuple (Note the comma!)
single = ("hello",)
```

**Important:** Without the comma, Python does not recognize it as a tuple:

```python
not_a_tuple = ("hello")  # This is a string, NOT a tuple
```

## üìù Quiz 1: Creating Tuples

**Q1. Which of the following correctly creates a single-element tuple?**
- A) `single = ("hello")`
- B) `single = ("hello",)`
- C) `single = ["hello"]`
- D) `single = {"hello"}`

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: B) `single = ("hello",)`**

A single-element tuple requires a trailing comma. Without it, Python treats it as a string in parentheses.
</details>

**Q2. What is the data type of `x` after this assignment: `x = (1, 2, 3)`?**
- A) list
- B) set
- C) tuple
- D) dict

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: C) tuple**

Parentheses with comma-separated values create a tuple.
</details>

---

## Accessing Elements

Use indexing just like lists:

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

print(fruits[0])   # apple
print(fruits[1])   # banana
print(fruits[-1])  # cherry
```


## Slicing Tuples

Tuples support slicing operations:

```python
numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

print(numbers[1:4])    # (20, 30, 40)
print(numbers[:3])     # (10, 20, 30)
print(numbers[2:])     # (30, 40, 50)
```

---

## üìù Quiz 2: Accessing and Slicing

**Q1. Given `colors = ("red", "green", "blue", "yellow")`, what will `colors[-2]` return?**
- A) "red"
- B) "green"
- C) "blue"
- D) "yellow"

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: C) "blue"**

Negative indexing starts from the end: -1 is "yellow", -2 is "blue".
</details>

**Q2. What will be the output of `numbers[1:4]` for `numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)`?**
- A) (10, 20, 30)
- B) (20, 30, 40)
- C) (20, 30, 40, 50)
- D) (30, 40)

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: B) (20, 30, 40)**

Slicing `[1:4]` includes indices 1, 2, and 3 (elements 20, 30, 40), but excludes index 4.
</details>

## Tuple Immutability

Tuples cannot be modified after creation:

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# This will raise an error:
fruits[1] = "mango"
```

**Output:**

```
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

This property makes tuples **safe for constant data**, like coordinates, fixed configurations, etc.

---

## üìù Quiz 3: Tuple Immutability

**Q1. What happens when you try to modify a tuple element?**
- A) The element is successfully modified
- B) Python creates a new tuple
- C) A TypeError is raised
- D) The entire tuple is deleted

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: C) A TypeError is raised**

Tuples are immutable, so attempting to modify them raises a `TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment`.
</details>

**Q2. Which statement about tuple immutability is TRUE?**
- A) You can add elements to a tuple using append()
- B) You can change elements but not delete them
- C) Tuples cannot be modified after creation
- D) Only the first element of a tuple is immutable

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: C) Tuples cannot be modified after creation**

Tuples are completely immutable - you cannot add, remove, or modify any elements after creation.
</details>

## Tuple Methods

Tuples have only **two built-in methods**:

| Method     | Description                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `count(x)` | Counts how many times `x` occurs in the tuple    |
| `index(x)` | Returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` |

### Example

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4)

print(numbers.count(2))  # 3
print(numbers.index(3))  # 2
```

---

## üìù Quiz 4: Tuple Methods

**Q1. Given `nums = (5, 10, 15, 10, 20, 10)`, what will `nums.count(10)` return?**
- A) 1
- B) 2
- C) 3
- D) 10

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: C) 3**

The `count()` method returns how many times the value 10 appears in the tuple, which is 3 times.
</details>

**Q2. How many built-in methods do tuples have?**
- A) 0
- B) 2
- C) 5
- D) Same as lists

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: B) 2**

Tuples have only two built-in methods: `count()` and `index()`.
</details>

## Tuple Packing and Unpacking

**Packing:** Combining values into a tuple:

```python
data = "John", 25, "Engineer"
print(data)  # ('John', 25, 'Engineer')
```

**Unpacking:** Assigning tuple elements to variables:

```python
name, age, profession = data

print(name)       # John
print(age)        # 25
print(profession) # Engineer
```


## Nested Tuples

Tuples can contain other tuples or collections:

```python
nested = (
    (1, 2, 3),
    ("a", "b", "c"),
    (True, False)
)

print(nested[1])        # ('a', 'b', 'c')
print(nested[1][2])     # 'c'
```

---

## üìù Quiz 5: Packing and Unpacking

**Q1. What is tuple unpacking?**
- A) Removing elements from a tuple
- B) Assigning tuple elements to individual variables
- C) Converting a tuple to a list
- D) Creating a nested tuple

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: B) Assigning tuple elements to individual variables**

Tuple unpacking assigns each element of a tuple to separate variables in a single statement.
</details>

**Q2. Given `person = ("Alice", 30, "Developer")` and `name, age, job = person`, what is the value of `age`?**
- A) "Alice"
- B) 30
- C) "Developer"
- D) Error

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: B) 30**

During unpacking, the second element (30) is assigned to the second variable (age).
</details>

## Tuple vs. List

| Feature     | Tuple                     | List                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Syntax      | `(1, 2, 3)`               | `[1, 2, 3]`                    |
| Mutability  | Immutable (cannot change) | Mutable (can change)           |
| Methods     | count(), index() only     | Many built-in methods          |
| Use Case    | Fixed data, safe storage  | Dynamic data, frequent changes |
| Performance | Slightly faster           | Slightly slower                |


## When to Use Tuples

**Use tuples when:**

* Data should **not change**.
* You need **hashable** objects (e.g., as dictionary keys).
* You want to protect data integrity.

**Examples:**

* Geographic coordinates: `(latitude, longitude)`
* RGB color codes: `(255, 255, 255)`
* Database records


## Tuple Comprehension

**Note:** Python does NOT have tuple comprehensions.
However, you can use a **generator expression** in parentheses:

```python
gen = (x*x for x in range(5))
print(gen)  # <generator object ...>
```

To create a tuple from it, use `tuple()`:

```python
squares = tuple(x*x for x in range(5))
print(squares)  # (0, 1, 4, 9, 16)
```

## üìù Final Quiz: Comprehensive Review

**Q1. Which of the following is a valid use case for tuples?**
- A) Storing a shopping cart that frequently changes
- B) Storing geographic coordinates that should remain constant
- C) Implementing a stack with push and pop operations
- D) Storing a to-do list that gets updated regularly

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: B) Storing geographic coordinates that should remain constant**

Tuples are ideal for fixed data that shouldn't change, like coordinates. For dynamic data that changes frequently, lists are more appropriate.
</details>

**Q2. What is the main advantage of tuples over lists?**
- A) Tuples can store more elements
- B) Tuples are immutable and protect data integrity
- C) Tuples have more built-in methods
- D) Tuples use less syntax

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: B) Tuples are immutable and protect data integrity**

The immutability of tuples ensures data cannot be accidentally modified, making them safer for constant data.
</details>

**Q3. Can tuples be used as dictionary keys?**
- A) No, never
- B) Yes, because they are hashable due to immutability
- C) Only if they contain strings
- D) Yes, but only empty tuples

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: B) Yes, because they are hashable due to immutability**

Tuples are hashable (because they're immutable), which allows them to be used as dictionary keys, unlike lists.
</details>

**Q4. Does Python support tuple comprehension?**
- A) Yes, using parentheses like (x for x in range(5))
- B) No, but you can use generator expressions and convert to tuple
- C) Yes, using square brackets
- D) Yes, using curly braces

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Answer: B) No, but you can use generator expressions and convert to tuple**

Python doesn't have tuple comprehension. Parentheses create generator expressions, which can be converted to tuples using `tuple()`.
</details>

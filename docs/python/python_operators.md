# Python Operators

In Python, **operators** are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports a wide variety of operators categorized based on their functionality.


Used to perform basic mathematical operations:

| Operator | Description       | Example   | Result |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| `+`      | Addition           | `10 + 5`  | `15`   |
| `-`      | Subtraction        | `10 - 5`  | `5`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication     | `10 * 5`  | `50`   |
| `/`      | Division           | `10 / 5`  | `2.0`  |
| `//`     | Floor Division     | `10 // 3` | `3`    |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder)| `10 % 3`  | `1`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation     | `2 ** 3`  | `8`    |

## Comparison Operators

Used to compare two values and return a Boolean result (`True` or `False`).

| Operator | Description          | Example     | Result |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|--------|
| `==`     | Equal to             | `5 == 5`    | `True` |
| `!=`     | Not equal to         | `5 != 3`    | `True` |
| `>`      | Greater than         | `5 > 3`     | `True` |
| `<`      | Less than            | `5 < 3`     | `False`|
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal| `5 >= 5`    | `True` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal   | `5 <= 3`    | `False`|


## Logical Operators

Used to combine conditional statements here.

| Operator | Description                       | Example              | Result |
|----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| `and`    | True if both operands are true    | `True and False`     | `False`|
| `or`     | True if at least one is true      | `True or False`      | `True` |
| `not`    | Reverses the result               | `not True`           | `False`|

### ðŸ§  Quiz 2: Comparison and Logical Operators

**Question 1:** What will `10 == 10.0` return?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `True`

**Explanation:** Python compares the values, not the types. Since 10 and 10.0 have the same value, the comparison returns `True`. To check if they're the same type, you'd use `type(10) == type(10.0)` which would return `False`.
</details>

**Question 2:** Evaluate: `(5 > 3) and (10 < 20)`

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `True`

**Explanation:** Both conditions are true: 5 is greater than 3 AND 10 is less than 20. The `and` operator returns `True` only when both conditions are true.
</details>

**Question 3:** What is the result of `not (5 > 10)`?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `True`

**Explanation:** First, `5 > 10` evaluates to `False`. Then, `not False` becomes `True`. The `not` operator reverses the boolean value.
</details>

**Question 4:** What will be the output?
```python
x = 15
result = (x > 10) or (x < 5)
```

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `True`

**Explanation:** The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one condition is true. Here, `x > 10` is `True` (15 > 10), so the entire expression is `True` without even checking the second condition.
</details>

---

## Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Example  | Same as        |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| `=`      | `x = 5`  | Assign 5 to x  |
| `+=`     | `x += 3` | `x = x + 3`    |
| `-=`     | `x -= 2` | `x = x - 2`    |
| `*=`     | `x *= 4` | `x = x * 4`    |
| `/=`     | `x /= 2` | `x = x / 2`    |
| `//=`    | `x //= 2`| `x = x // 2`   |
| `%=`     | `x %= 2` | `x = x % 2`    |
| `**=`    | `x **= 2`| `x = x ** 2`   |

---

### ðŸ§  Quiz 3: Assignment Operators

**Question 1:** If `x = 10`, what will be the value of `x` after `x += 5`?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `15`

**Explanation:** `x += 5` is shorthand for `x = x + 5`. So, 10 + 5 = 15.
</details>

**Question 2:** What will be the final value of `y`?
```python
y = 20
y -= 8
y *= 2
```

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `24`

**Explanation:** 
- Start: `y = 20`
- After `y -= 8`: `y = 12` (20 - 8)
- After `y *= 2`: `y = 24` (12 Ã— 2)
</details>

**Question 3:** If `a = 7`, what is `a` after `a %= 3`?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `1`

**Explanation:** `a %= 3` is equivalent to `a = a % 3`. So, 7 % 3 = 1 (remainder when 7 is divided by 3).
</details>

## Bitwise Operators

Used to perform bit-level operations.

| Operator | Description | Example   | Result |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| `&`      | AND         | `5 & 3`   | `1`    |
| `|`      | OR          | `5 | 3`   | `7`    |
| `^`      | XOR         | `5 ^ 3`   | `6`    |
| `~`      | NOT         | `~5`      | `-6`   |
| `<<`     | Left Shift  | `5 << 1`  | `10`   |
| `>>`     | Right Shift | `5 >> 1`  | `2`    |


## Membership Operators

Used to test if a sequence contains a value.

| Operator   | Description                  | Example              | Result |
|------------|------------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| `in`       | Value exists in the sequence | `"a" in "apple"`     | `True` |
| `not in`   | Value not in sequence        | `"z" not in "apple"` | `True` |


## Identity Operators

Used to compare the memory location of two objects.

| Operator   | Description                         | Example     | Result |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|--------|
| `is`       | Returns `True` if same object       | `x is y`    | `True` |
| `is not`   | Returns `True` if not same object   | `x is not y`| `True` |

### ðŸ§  Quiz 4: Membership and Identity Operators

**Question 1:** What will `3 in [1, 2, 3, 4]` return?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `True`

**Explanation:** The `in` operator checks if a value exists in a sequence. Since 3 is present in the list, it returns `True`.
</details>

**Question 2:** What is the output?
```python
text = "Python Programming"
result = "Java" not in text
```

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `True`

**Explanation:** The string "Java" is not found in "Python Programming", so `"Java" not in text` returns `True`.
</details>

**Question 3:** What's the difference between `==` and `is`?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `==` compares values, `is` compares object identity (memory location)

**Explanation:** 
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

a == b  # True (same values)
a is b  # False (different objects in memory)
a is c  # True (same object)
```
</details>

**Question 4:** What will this code output?
```python
x = [1, 2]
y = [1, 2]
print(x is y)
print(x == y)
```

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** 
```
False
True
```

**Explanation:** `x` and `y` have the same values but are different objects in memory. So `x == y` is `True` (same values) but `x is y` is `False` (different memory locations).
</details>

- Second `score += 10`: score = 70
</details>

**Question 4:** What is the result of `10 + 5 * 2 ** 2`?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `30`

**Explanation:** Following operator precedence (PEMDAS):
- First: `2 ** 2` = 4 (exponentiation)
- Then: `5 * 4` = 20 (multiplication)
- Finally: `10 + 20` = 30 (addition)
</details>

**Question 5:** In the file permission system, what permission value represents all three permissions (read=4, write=2, execute=1)?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:** `7`

**Explanation:** Using bitwise OR: `4 | 2 | 1 = 7`. This combines all three permissions. This is commonly seen in Unix/Linux file permissions (chmod 777).

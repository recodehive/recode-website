### Python Syntax Example

Here is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!":


```python
print("Hello, World!")
````

 Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

You can run this code in any Python interpreter, and it will display the message on the screen.


### Good to know

1. The most recent major version of Python is **Python 3**, which is the version used in most tutorials today. Although **Python 2** is no longer maintained, it is still used in some legacy systems.
2. Python files use the **`.py`** extension.
3. You can write Python code in a text editor or an IDE like **VS Code**, **PyCharm**, **Thonny**, or **Jupyter Notebook**.
4. Python is widely used in both academic research and industry for automating tasks, analyzing data, building applications, and more.


### ðŸ“¦ Installing Python

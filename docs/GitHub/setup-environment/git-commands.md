> *This is part of GitHub/Git Tutorials and a continuation of the previous post where we discussed what is gitHub. I hope you have a basic understanding of what is Github in general. Let’s get started with Git Cheat Sheet. Git Cheat Sheet. 50 Git commands | Git Tutorials*

Git commands are handy when comes to fix any problems which you cant fix by the UI, for example consider a scenarion you need to fix the conflict in a page. Git Commands will help you to find the root cause and can explore the entire log history. At Git core it help you to keep a history of every change you made in the project files and help the user with track the changes, revert, helps to identify who made the changes. 

## Understanding Git: The Building Blocks

In Setting up git on Windows tutorial you learned to perform how to check the current version of the git. Now below you will see how to add some changes to the files you have created. I assume you have a small project where you created a file called filename.ipynb, now you want to add that into the git. 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Git Code" label="Git Code">
  
  ```html title="Adding file to the repo"
   git add filename.ipynb
    ```

    </TabItem>
    
    <TabItem value="how-git-works" label="Output on browser">
      ![alt text](./assets/image-1.png)
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example, the `<h1>` tag creates a heading, and the `<p>` tag creates a paragraph. The browser interprets these tags and displays the content accordingly. HTML tags can be nested within each other to create more complex structures, such as lists, tables, forms, and more.


## How Web Browsers Render HTML

When a user requests a web page by entering a URL in the browser's address bar or clicking a link, the browser sends a request to the web server hosting the page. The server responds by sending the HTML content of the page back to the browser. The browser then parses the HTML code and renders the page on the user's screen.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Git Code" label="Git Code">
  
  ```html title="Commiting the changes"
  git commit -m "Give some meaningfull comments"
    ```

    </TabItem>
    
    <TabItem value="how-git-works" label="Output on browser">
      ![alt text](./assets/image-1.png)
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Pushing Changes to the branch**

    :::info
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Git Code" label="Git Code">
  
  ```html title="Uploading file to the remote"
 git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch] -> Push the branch on github :
    ```

    </TabItem>
    
    <TabItem value="how-git-works" label="Output on browser">
      ![alt text](./assets/image-1.png)
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
    :::

3. **Git Pull**: The browser paints the pixels on the screen according to the layout determined in the rendering step. It combines the content, styles, and layout to create the final visual representation of the web page.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Git Code" label="Git Code">
  
  ```html title="Uploading file to the remote"
 git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch] -> Push the branch on github :
    ```

    </TabItem>
    
    <TabItem value="how-git-works" label="Output on browser">
      ![alt text](./assets/image-1.png)
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
    :::
4. **Reflow and Repaint**: If the user interacts with the page, such as scrolling or resizing the window, the browser may need to reflow and repaint parts of the page to reflect the changes. Reflow involves recalculating the layout of the affected elements, while repaint involves updating the affected pixels on the screen.

By understanding how web browsers render HTML content, web developers can optimize their code and design to create fast and responsive web pages. Techniques such as minimizing the use of inline styles, reducing the number of DOM elements, and optimizing images can help improve the performance of web pages and provide a better user experience.


## Useful 50 Git Commands Cheatsheet

In addition to rendering HTML content, web browsers handle various resources associated with a web page, including:

- **CSS Stylesheets**: Browsers download and apply CSS stylesheets to control the presentation of HTML elements. Stylesheets can be linked externally using the `<link>` tag or embedded within the HTML document using the `<style>` tag.

    For example, the following HTML code snippet links an external CSS stylesheet to the web page:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="HTML Code" label="HTML Code">
      
      ```html title="git configuration commands"
     git --version
      git config _\--global #for global level config_
      git config _#for project level config_
      git config --global user.name <"name">
      git config --global user.email <"email">
      git config --global core.editor <"editor">
      git config --global color.ui true
        ```

        </TabItem>
  

        <TabItem value="Output On Browser" label="Output On Browser">
          <BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html" bodyStyle={{fontFamily: "Arial, sans-serif", backgroundColor: "#f9f9f9"}}>
            <h1 style={{color: "#333"}}>Hello, World!</h1>
            <p style={{color: "#666"}}>This is my first web page.</p>
          </BrowserWindow>
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>


**Git Basic Commands**

By managing these resources efficiently, web developers can create engaging and interactive web pages that deliver a rich user experience. Understanding how HTML works with web browsers and how browsers render content is essential for building modern web applications that meet user expectations and performance standards.

GitLab is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a **Git repository manager**, issue tracking, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and more. It is similar to GitHub but focuses heavily on providing an **all-in-one platform** for software development and DevOps.

:::note
Key Features of GitLab:
- GitLab is not only a Git-based repository management tool but also provides **built-in CI/CD pipelines**.  
- Unlike GitHub, GitLab can be **self-hosted** as well as used on the cloud (GitLab.com).  
- GitLab offers <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/">Premium Plans</a> with advanced CI/CD, security, compliance, and scalability features.

## How to start with GitLab?

When developers create new projects or collaborate on existing ones, they need a place to host, version, and automate their workflows. GitLab provides this with the **additional advantage of integrated DevOps tools** such as issue boards, pipelines, and monitoring.

Other alternatives include GitHub, Bitbucket, and Azure Repos. GitLab is often preferred in organizations where **self-hosting** and **end-to-end DevOps** automation are critical.

:::info
In the picture below, you can see multiple developers working on the same project. For example, Developer 1 handles the backend APIs, Developer 2 builds the frontend interface, and Developer 3 manages CI/CD pipeline setup.

Each developer works on their local copy of the repository and pushes their changes to the **remote GitLab repository**. After a merge request (MR) review, the maintainer merges the changes into the main branch. GitLab can then automatically trigger a **pipeline** to build, test, and deploy the new version of the project.

## Why Learn GitLab?

GitLab is more than just version control‚Äîit provides a complete DevOps platform.  
Here‚Äôs why you should learn it:

1. **Integrated DevOps** ‚Äì GitLab includes planning, coding, testing, security, deployment, and monitoring in one place.  
2. **Self-hosting option** ‚Äì Unlike GitHub, GitLab allows organizations to run GitLab on their own servers.  
3. **Automation with CI/CD** ‚Äì GitLab‚Äôs pipelines make testing and deployment faster and less error-prone.  
4. **Collaboration** ‚Äì Teams can manage issues, boards, milestones, and code reviews easily.  
5. **Industry demand** ‚Äì Many companies prefer GitLab for its **security compliance** and DevOps workflows.

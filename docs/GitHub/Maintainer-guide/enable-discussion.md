In the previous post we spoke about commit, fork, clone, in this post we gonna deep dive into the terminology by creating a GitHub Repository from the Scratch. 
Inorder to create a project and host, the repository is a place where you add all your program code files and other documentation. 

### Prerequisites

- 1. You should have a Github account 
- 2. Should have a basic understanding of how Git works/ and Git running in your OS.

### How to create Github Repository

**Step 1:** Go to GitHub page, by default you will be in the Home page as shown below, Step 1 requires you to click on the ``+`` Icon and from the drop down click on the ``New Repository``.

    </BrowserWindow>
**Step 2:** Specify the name of the Project, make It public or private, for this tutorial you will make it public, Once the repository is gone private the project admin have to give permission or manually added other GitHub user to collaborate or make it visible. This is usual application in the organisation level. The next step check on the readme file, this allows you to create a ``readme.md`` file along with the repository creation. Then click on ``Create repository`` on the button below.
